<h1>The best movies according to Maria</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The silence of the lambs</h3>
<p>It's a movie, that captivates me every time, no matter how often I watch it. Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are playing their role absolutely amazing.</p>
<h3>What dreams may come</h3>
<p>A movie with beautiful pictures full of fantasy an deep life philosophy at the same time. In my opinion one of the greatest roles Robin Williams had ever played.</p>
<h3>The last unicorn</h3>
<p>A beautiful animated story suitable for all times an ages. The title song makes me cry every time.</p>
